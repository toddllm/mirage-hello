# 🎬 Mirage Hello: Open Source Real-Time Video Diffusion

## 🚀 Join the Journey to Recreate Mirage's Magic

This project is an **open-source community effort** to understand, implement, and optimize real-time video generation like Mirage/Daycart achieved. We're building from first principles, learning together, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

### 🎥 Background: The Mirage/Daycart Breakthrough

This project is inspired by the groundbreaking work showcased in this interview with Dean, co-founder and CEO of Daycart:

[![Mirage/Daycart Real-Time Video Generation Interview](video-preview.png)](https://youtu.be/E23cV48Iv9A?si=dUPEDIwvhvIT-r-p)

**Key Insights from the Interview:**

**The Technical Challenge:**
> *"That same problem that LLMs dealt with a few years ago comes back when you try to do auto regressive video models... the model gets stuck in this loop until it just gets stuck on a single color and your entire screen just becomes reds or blue or green"*

**The Performance Breakthrough:**
> *"The current version that you saw is 40 millisecond delay. The next version of Mirage is going to be 16 milliseconds delay"*

**The Technical Innovation:**
> *"We sat and wrote lots of assembly for GPUs. It's called PTX... It's the actual assembly that gets written on the GPU... we had to write very very optimized assembly code for GPUs to get this to be efficient"*

**The Architecture:**
> *"It's kind of like training a video model just on next frame prediction and not next token prediction. You just have to predict the next frame each time"*

**The Breakthrough Approach:**
- **Frame-by-Frame Generation**: Unlike traditional video models that generate entire sequences, Mirage predicts one frame at a time autoregressively
- **Error Accumulation Solution**: Solved the critical problem where video models "get stuck in loops" and degrade to single colors
- **PTX Assembly Optimization**: Hand-written GPU assembly code to achieve the extreme performance required for real-time generation
- **Live Stream Processing**: Processes input and generates output streams in real-time, not batch processing

**Why This Matters:**
Mirage/Daycart achieved something unprecedented - **real-time video-to-video transformation** at 25+ FPS with plans for 62.5+ FPS. But their solution is closed-source. We're building the open alternative that makes this technology accessible to everyone.

## 🎯 What We've Built So Far

We've created a working foundation that demonstrates the **real computational challenges** of video diffusion:

- ✅ **GPU-Intensive Models**: 391M-880M parameter implementations
- ✅ **100% GPU Utilization**: Actually stresses hardware (11GB memory usage)  
- ✅ **Error Accumulation Prevention**: Context memory systems
- ✅ **Performance Benchmarking**: Shows we're 6x slower than Mirage's 40ms target
- ✅ **Progressive Scaling**: Demonstrates where bottlenecks occur

### 📊 Current Performance Reality

```
🔥 Heavy Load Results (880M parameters):
   GPU Utilization: 85.6% average, 100% peak
   Memory Usage: 11GB / 24GB (45% of RTX 3090)
   Performance: 20.5 FPS (0.24s per sequence) 
   Mirage Target: 25 FPS (0.04s) - we're 6x too slow
   Next-Gen Target: 62.5 FPS (0.016s) - we're 15x too slow
```

This shows **exactly why Mirage needed PTX assembly optimizations** - the problem is genuinely hard!
