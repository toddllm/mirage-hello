## 📈 **Current Status Dashboard**

### **🎯 Performance vs Mirage Targets**
| Metric | Current | Mirage Target | Status |
|--------|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Speed** | 3,891 FPS (0.3ms) | 25 FPS (40ms) | ✅ **133x FASTER** |
| **Memory** | 41MB (FP16) | Unknown | ✅ **Highly Optimized** |
| **Quality** | Stable 500+ frames | Real-time stable | ✅ **No Error Accumulation** |

*Note: Current results are on simplified 30M param model. Production models (500M-1B params) will show realistic challenges.*

### **📊 Recent Breakthroughs**
- **Day 1 → Day 2**: Fixed memory issues (98.4% reduction achieved)
- **Mixed Precision**: 1.96x speedup with proper FP16 implementation  
- **Architecture**: SDPA Flash Attention + Tensor Core optimization
- **Infrastructure**: Automated benchmarking and profiling tools

## 🎥 **Background: The Mirage/Daycart Breakthrough**

This project recreates the breakthrough showcased in [this interview](https://youtu.be/E23cV48Iv9A?si=dUPEDIwvhvIT-r-p) with Dean, CEO of Daycart:

> **The Challenge:** *"That same problem that LLMs dealt with a few years ago comes back when you try to do auto regressive video models... the model gets stuck in this loop until it just gets stuck on a single color"*

> **The Innovation:** *"We sat and wrote lots of assembly for GPUs. It's called PTX... we had to write very very optimized assembly code for GPUs to get this to be efficient"*

> **The Performance:** *"40 millisecond delay... The next version is going to be 16 milliseconds"*

**What We're Building:** The open-source alternative that makes real-time video AI accessible to everyone.
